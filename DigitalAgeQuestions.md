## Forums and Questions ##

Every programmer, whether experienced or novice, has opened up some sort of forum seeking information. Many may have contributed questions to a forum and some, as I have, may have been met with a wave of silence. Did you, the writer of such a post, ever ponder why your question was ignored? Was it a new issue? Can no one answer such a question? 

Fortunately, in this day and age, just about every question you could possibly ask has an answer out there. So it just begs the question, why did no one answer my question? Well, it may just be the way the forum post was written. Writing good questions and producing quality forum posts involves a lot more than just asking for help. More often than not, if a forum post is not formulated properly, it will be ignored. So it just begs the question, how does one produce a forum post worth answering? And to answer that, let's look at a few examples. 

## The Good ##

Firstly, let’s look at an example that has one of the highest upvotes on the Stack Overflow site which was viewed over 11 million times. The post, created by Matthew Rankin, leads with the question: “How do I delete a Git branch locally and remotely?”. To make an informed post, one must have done a bit of research on the topic and have attempted to fix the error prior to seeking help. In the case of Mr. Rankin, he explains his attempts to delete his branch by displaying a set of varying terminal commands used (all variants of git branch -d). 

Though this may seem like a Google-able question, this post was created in 2010 and with GitHub being a fairly new tool at the time, the question is quite relevant. Furthermore, such a question would definitely be able to inform and aid other programmers struggling with the same issue. After explaining his attempts he ends by reiterating his original question: “How do I properly delete the remotes/origin/bugfix [referring to the branches hierarchical location] branch both locally and remotely?” clearly stating the question and giving context for the issue. 

With the issue and previous attempts clearly presented, responders have a clear idea of what the user understands and what pieces of information they are missing in order to complete their task. His post is short and to the point; devoid of any useless details or attempts to break down why he is having the issue. These traits contribute to why his question is so highly rated on Stack Overflow… not to mention helpful.

## The Bad ##

Next, let’s look at an example that has one of the highest upvotes on the Stack Overflow site which was viewed less than 100 times, yet got a negative score on Stack Overflow. The post, created by Trần Hữu Huân, leads with the question: “Please help stopping the form action”. Begging or having a sense of urgency is never a great way to lead into your issue at hand. The makings of a good question is to be clear and concise, which is quite the opposite in this post. 

Following the header, Trần writes “Check function not work !! Please help”. With his provided code he attempts to get JavaScript to run a PHP function, which is not possible (made clear by a response to the forum post). From his post, it is clear that there was no attempt to research the issue and, if there was prior research, there is no explanation of said research. Though, arguably, not an “easy” problem to fix via a Google search, Trần fails to provide information regarding what the program is supposed to do, just that the “Check function not work”. 

Moreover, it is clear that English is not Trần’s first language, which is not a problem but fails to inform users of this. This information is “important” as it gives justification for potentially unclear writing. To me, the most egregious part of this forum post is that he never states what the issue is; just a snippet of code and a plea for help. Being able to approach his question is quite difficult and would require questions from the community to come to a complete answer. A good question needs to be clearly communicated and, in this case, was quite lacking.

## Final Thoughts ##
Being capable of asking deep and intelligent questions opens the door to intelligent answers (and swift ones too)! Being able to provide as much information packed as clearly and densely as possible allows those on that forum to provide proper feedback. Asking questions that are lackluster and full of gaps is quite unappealing to those providing aid on forums such as Stack Overflow. Knowing when to use these forums and understanding how to form a purposeful question will aid all in their coding journey as it has surely helped me in the past. Though, admittingly, I too used to ask terrible questions and got the appropriate response; silence.
