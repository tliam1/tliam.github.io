This is a program that spits out a completely randomized texture pack. Each and every texture will be swapped around (besides post 1.19 textures) as well as the music/effects. This project was made to get familiar with Python and some of its offered libraries. Moreover, this was merely a fun idea that reaped a hilarious result. 

Here's how it works:

<hr>

<pre>
Each Minecraft texture is applied on a folder/name basis. If a cow's texture name were to suddenly be changed to say 'pig_front', then the pig would apply the cow's texture. However, the new pig texture must be held within the pig folder (all textures follow this rule). The same rules more or less apply to the music files.
