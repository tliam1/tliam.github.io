This program simulates the functions of a single-cycle processor by handling branches/conditional branches, additions, subtractions, and noOps. This program cycle shifts instruction sets through each stage of the processor (IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB).

IF: Instruction Fetch
ID: Instruction Decode
EX: Execute
MEM: Memory
WB: Write Back
