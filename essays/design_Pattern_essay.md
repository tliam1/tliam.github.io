## Design Patterns and the fish Analogy ##

Programming should always be kept simple. The number one rule: make your life easier and keep work productive. When solving software problems, programmers should rely on proven, reusable solutions that provide structure to the code base. This process is often referred to as creating design patterns. Say, for whatever reason, we want to draw a fish. In doing so, an artist would break down the fish into individual steps, or components, and draw this fish in sections based on the predefined components. Now if another type of animal has a similar trait, the artist can refer to the component of the fish and reapply the same technique. The same applies to design patterns in software development. 



## Where have we seen this before? ##

Commonly seen in the programs we created using React, each rendered page is through a component-based structure. Sections of the page (components), take a header, body, and footer as an example, are combined to form a complete page. Through this process, we are able to swap body components out to render new pages instead of repeating the process of creating a navbar and footer for each. The whole purpose of design patterns is to be fast, as fast as possible. Companies love efficiency and that means to save time and generate money. Being able to apply these coding design patterns will greatly impact one's career as a software engineer.
