## Overview ##

Many buildings here at UH Manoa are flooded with event flyers. Buildings such as Kuykendall Hall are a battleground for events competing for wall space. Why not an online space to easily share and find UH-related events? Flyers, which rarely are ever taken down after events end, would be automatically removed after the end date of the event (or some maximum). Students who sign in using their UH Manoa account and RSVP for events or publish their own events. The goal is to declutter campus hallways and give everyone a fair chance at exposure. 

## Page Mockup Ideas ##

The home page would be the main hub where events are displayed. Here, you may filter, search, and traverse through.
