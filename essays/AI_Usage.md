# Overview #

Advancements in AI have come a long way in the last decade alone. AI, or artificial intelligence, has taken the world by storm with utilities such as ChatGPT and CoPilot to name a few. AI, in the sphere of education, is a real threat to students but CAN be a great tool if used properly.  A threat due to the nature of irrational-minded people to cheat and helpful due to the aid it provides students. I feel as if this applies elsewhere, specifically in Software Engineering. I for one have used AI, specifically ChatGPT, a multitude of times over the last few years. Most usage is for non-school-related activities (previously for aiding in my understanding of the Godot game engine), but there are instances where it has cause small errors in larger coding assignments. 

# AI Usage #

While taking ICS314, the use of AI (specifically ChatGPT) was heavily minimized. 

### WODs ###
In all in-class WODs and practice WODs, AI was not used to aid in the completion of the assignments. I felt as if I would be cheating myself. These assignments were to test our understanding of recent concepts and using ChatGPT is like copying code from the professor before trying yourself, you learn nothing. 

### Essays & Final ###
The same goes for any essays and, currently, the final project. Essays are to be written with your own thoughts in mind. As for the final project, it encapsulates everything we learned during the semester, therefore I feel as if I am cheating myself if I utilize AI in this instance. 

### Experiences & Concepts ###
I have used ChatGPT for experience WODs that I have failed to complete in time due to any code-related issue (if I am just moving slowly, AI was not used). This was the case for 1-2 assignments throughout the semester. AI was also used to help in my understanding of specific concepts that I failed to understand. One instance of this was asking ChatGPT how to override bootstrap variables in a CSS file. 

### Asking & Answering Questions + Documentation ###
AI was not used for any asking or answering of questions within this course, nor any documentation of any code. I typically never answered questions; they were typically answered before I got to see them. Furthermore, I like to ask my questions as an AI might ask a question that doesnâ€™t quite show my understanding and the lack thereof. Documentation was in small demand for this course and as such AI was not needed for achieving this task. 

### Quality Assurance ###
As previously mentioned, I have used ChatGPT for a few experiences, particularly asking questions regarding where an issue in a file could exist in order to help locate any errors. Most code given by ChatGPT results in more complications so I typically use AI to locate errors rather than find solutions for them.
