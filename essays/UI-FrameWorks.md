## What are UI Frameworks? ##

I am just going to come out and say it. UI Frameworks are the saving grace for HTML. Simply put, a UI Framework is a collection of prebuilt libraries and elements that aid in the design of a user interface, UI. One might ask, “Why not just use CSS?” and to that I’d slap you across the face because the time required to build something of quality with raw HTML and CSS is far from worth it.  Due to the nature of user interfaces being a prebuilt resource you can get up and running in minutes. Not only this, but you can alter these prebuilt libraries to fit your needs. Essentially, UI Frameworks do the hard work for you (if you know what you are doing) with the small tweaks left to be done by the user.

## My Complaints ##

Though useful, UI Frameworks, like Bootstrap 5, can be tedious and hard to learn. Since these UI Frameworks have their own libraries, it leaves another set of documentation to read over before becoming useful. Personally, I have found it more useful to use Bootstrap over raw CSS, but making tweaks to these libraries may come off as tedious. If you really want to stylize a preset library to make it stand out from the rest, you’ll have to override the properties of the classes provided. This is a big contrast from raw CSS as you can simply add or tweak or remove class variables that are readily available/visible. Some of Bootstrap's class properties are seemingly hidden and overriding them was not an obvious and simple task. If there was one complaint I could make about my experience as a beginner with Bootstrap, this would definitely be it. 

## Why use it? ##

Even with the extra work required to completely understand a UI Framework, I’d say it is absolutely necessary for all web developers. It speeds up the production of a website prototype and easily stylizes sections of a webpage. From my experience, I can gladly say good riddance to raw CSS and HTML. The images below show just how night and day. Given approximately the same amount of time to produce a web page, the difference in quality is quite clear. UI Frameworks are a clear winner
