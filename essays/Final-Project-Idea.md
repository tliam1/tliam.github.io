## Overview ##

Many buildings here at UH Manoa are flooded with event flyers. Buildings such as Kuykendall Hall are a battleground for events competing for wall space. Why not an online space to easily share and find UH-related events? Flyers, which rarely are ever taken down after events end, would be automatically removed after the end date of the event (or some maximum). Students who sign in using their UH Manoa account and RSVP for events and/or publish their own events. The goal is to declutter campus hallways and give everyone a fair chance at exposure. 

## Page Mockup Ideas ##
- Landing Page / Home Page
    - The home page would be the central hub where events are displayed. Here, you may filter, search, and traverse through all uploaded events.
- Sign In Page
    - Here the user will sign in using their UH email which will be required to post/host an event or RSVP.
- Event creation page
    - Here you will create the event with basic info: When, Where, Description
- Event Edit Page
    - This page allows event creators or system admins to edit/delete an event.
- Saved Events Page
    - Users can save events that interest them. Instead of searching for them again, they will appear on this page upon logging in.
 
 ## Use Case Ideas ##
 For those seeking to host an event or save events they are interested in, users will be required to log in. For looking through the catalog of events, a login is not required. Event hosts can freely alter their event information at any time, while normal users will not have such access. System admins will have full control over all events and can edit them as needed. 

  ## Beyond the Basics ##
- Allowing a sign-up option for event registration
    - Cap on the amount registered
- Transactions for paid events
